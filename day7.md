## P0f
```

analizes a packet and looks for a signature to match it to a type of host
p0f -r <file.pcap>
p0f <interface>

```

## Network Baselining
```

7 days to establish initial snapshot(weekend should be different)
verify port / protocol usage
look at how people normally use network
identify normal vs. peak preformance time frames

```

## Wireshark
```

dns contains com
dns.qry.name contains motors

```

## TCPDUMP
```



```

## network data types
```

full packet capture data
Session data (sflow, netflow)
statistical data
alert
log

```

## Data Collection
```

TAP
SPAN - rouers/switches - copies data and forwards it elsewhere
ARP Spoofing - 

```

## Anomaly Detection
```

Indicator of attack(IOA)
proactive


Indicator of compromise(IOC)
reactive

```

## Indicators
```

Executable files
NOP sled
Repeated letters
well known signatures
mismatched protocols
unusual traffic
large ammount of traffic/ unusual times

```

## Indicators of attack
```

destinations/ports
public servers/dmz 
off-hours
network scans
alarm events
malware reinfection

```

## indicators of compromiise
```

unusual traffic
weird account access
packet sized
high number of rquests for the same file
using weird ports


```

## malware
```

metamorphic -- changes the code based on environment
mobile code(cross platform code)


```

## decoding
```

enca, chardet, iconv

```
